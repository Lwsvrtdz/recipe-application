# Recipe Application

This project is a practice exercise to explore the latest features of NuxtJS, as I haven't worked with it in a while. It's an opportunity to refresh my skills and discover what's new in the framework.

## Project Overview

- Built with NuxtJS 3
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements Vue Router for navigation
- Incorporates Google Fonts for typography

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow includes:

- Automatic deployment on pushes to the master branch
- Manual deployment option via workflow dispatch
- Building and testing the application
- Deploying to a VPS using SSH

For more details, see the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.
